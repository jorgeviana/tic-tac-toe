# Try Tic Tac Toe with TDD

Choose your favorite language or add it if it's missing!

The `main` branch contains the initial scafolding for each language, create branches with meaningful names to try out your solution. Example: `alice-reactjs-some-description'

In `some-description` you can say something about your goal, like "I was trying to decouple logic from components"

Good luck!
