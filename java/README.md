## Java workshop!

It's convenient to open your IDE directly in the `java` folder.  
All you need is to have Java installed on your system (we are using Java 17 at this moment, see `build.gradle.kts` config).  
You don't need to install Gradle as the project already comes with the Gradle Wrapper.

To see if everything is working, type in the terminal:

`gradlew.bat test`

or if you're on a linux shell

`./gradlew test`
